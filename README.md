## Running

* Compile all source files with ````javac````
* Run program with ````java <program name>````

## Further Work

* The code has been commented simplistically but could be extended further
* A few TODOs as graphical improvements have been commented in the code, these include:
	* Reload
	* Feedback when all bees die
	* More efficient setup of GUI
